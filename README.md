# libqt6pas
Unoffical repo for hopefully current LibQt6Pas libraries for Linux

WARNING - the release numbers are about to change and that means you 
will need to remove an existing 6.2.3 before installing the new one. 

Might be a good idea to hold off for a few hours before down loading.

Sorry, Davo
